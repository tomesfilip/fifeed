## Why not?
I mean… Really! Why wouldn't you want to go for a long "vacation" for free? All you need to have is little bit of time to fill out some papers.

## Misleading words up there...
Long vacation? Is it? After 143 days, I can definitely say it was not long enough. And was it really a vacation? That's hard to define, for each one of us the word vacation means something else.

What about the claim about the paperwork? Yes, that sucks. But believe it or not, it sucks for both sides, for the universities and for you. Brace yourself and do it.

## Is (or will be) there a better time to go abroad?
Yes and no. In an ideal and "free" world, you can to go anywhere, whenever you want (or whenever you have time and money for it). As a student, I have had neither (not that I have one of these now). Just the passion for traveling. So, the Erasmus was a wonderful choice, since I haven't paid that much from my pocket over these 143 days.

**Let's get into the fears or concerns I had before:**
1. How will I manage all of the paperwork?
2. What about the job I have?
3. Who will be my friend in there?
4. Another useless overthinking questions…

The concerns are good. Just define them, and try to look for solutions. Thousands of people have done it before. How much different you are?

## How it went?

First, I made the decision to go. Then, I wrote down all of these questions. Within a while, I was able to find relatively easy solutions.

Paperwork? We've split between myself and my friend Peter. He was (and still is) my classmate (and a very good friend) doing the same subjects. He helped me a lot, not gonna lie. We just followed the directions written on the university's website, wrote a few emails, and filled out the papers. In the end, it might have taken around 5 hours of work before going there. Overall, all of the administrative was not as bad as I expected. A lot of the processes are digitalized, which makes the work easier. 

After filling out the papers that consisted mainly of course pairing documents, I was ready to solve the next issue. My employer allowed me to work remotely during my stay. Appreciated it. At least, I still had some additional income. That was easy. Just one paper signed. Nothing was standing in my way anymore. I was free to go. 

On the 17th of January, my parents took me to the Vienna airport. There, I've met up with Peter (classmate) and we flew together to Tallinn (the capital of Estonia). It was cold, melted snow everywhere (not water, just the white chunks of snow here and there). We've ordered a Bolt (carsharing platform / taxi) to take us to the academic hostel. The driver called us on the phone since he was unable to find us. The call didn't help us either, since he was talking only in Russian (the second most spoken language in Estonia). He drove away… We took a taxi. Just a tip: If you ever go to Tallinn, just take the tram/bus which is right in front of the airport. Never mind, we just wanted a funny story to tell. 

The first few weeks were extremely busy. Party there, organizational stuff around studies there, ESN (Erasmus network organization) events there. Busy, yes, but I've met so many genuine people (since the beginning, I remembered the names of only each fifth person). We're lucky to have a great group from Czechia and Slovakia, as well as the international group. Since the first day, I felt like I belonged there, this very feeling lasted until the end. Since there were so many people doing Erasmus, they usually were near me all the time. Therefore, I could just write to a group chat and ask somebody out to do something fun. We played badminton, had workouts together, had picnics, had movie nights, had cooking nights... Lots of fun, what can I say.

From the school's perspective. I was kindly surprised that we're able to choose subjects out of the scope of our home faculty (applied informatics). This way, I attended classes like business communication (which gave me the most in terms of being able to speak in front of people), managerial psychology, social engineering, and public service system implementation (this one was also a huge boost for my confidence). All of the subjects were aimed at a different approach - 80% practical, 20% theoretical. It was so much easier than at home university. But don't get me wrong, easy doesn't mean I haven't learned anything. It was far less stressing, and by the practical approach, I learned much more.

Traveling around was another big plus. Especially, when I experienced the Lapland trip. It was the most stunning trip of my life (read more here, hopefully I will write the blog from there). Shortly described in four points: **-30&#176;C**, **snow scooters**, **night hike**, **auroras**. Three times, I went to Latvia - the first time for an international ice hockey match (Slovakia played), the second, to meet my friend who was visiting me. The third time was with my parents on the way back home. Other trips were mostly around Estonia, wandering through its nature wonders - forests and bogs. By the way, hitchhiking is extremely easy in Estonia. Once, we hitchhiked in a group of three during winter and we waited around 30 minutes (which is a short time given the circumstances). Due to traveling, I also missed one exam. Well, happens. Since I had enough credits, I didn't care that much (irresponsible me). The course was waiting for me in the upcoming year.

## Overall experience
Much better than I expected. I made new friends, had a lot of fun, learned a lot about myself, got a lot from a soft skills perspective, improved my English - especially speaking in public, and used every opportunity to travel. Thanks to Erasmus, I  realized how I'd like to live my life. 

*Erasmus's experience will always stay with me. Thank you.*

PS: If you're considering it, you're already halfway there.
