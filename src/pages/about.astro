  <p>
    Tomeš, Filip Tomeš. Student and graduate of Software Engineering, passionate
    traveler, and a happy person to be alive.

  <p>
    The main reason for this blog is to do something during nights when I feel,
    I want to share my thoughts on topics that interest me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I try to write in my way with my point of view (it might not be the same for
    everyone but hey, I don't care). Time to time, I add some pictures to make
    it easier for non-readers.
